"""build_hint and analyze_complexity. Implements ISSUE-007 FR3.

``build_hint`` is where PracticeAgent's academic-integrity boundary stops being
a sentence in a prompt.

The guarantee is structural, not textual: **every hint this tool can return is
drawn from a table an author wrote.** The model chooses a rung on the ladder;
it does not supply the words. So the tool cannot emit a solution for the same
reason a lookup table cannot -- there is no path from the model's output to the
returned string. A test asserts exactly that, over every reachable hint.

That is a stronger property than scanning the output for the answer, which only
catches the phrasings the test author thought of.
